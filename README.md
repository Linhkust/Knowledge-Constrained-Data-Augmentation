# Knowledge-Constrained-Data-Augmentation
Data and codes for the Paper "Enhancing the prediction accuracy of concrete properties with knowledge constrained data augmentation and tabular foundation model"
1. The folder `datasets` stores the 15 datasets used in the study.
2. The `data_aug.py` defines four data augmentation models: GaussianCopula, CTGAN, CopulaGAN, and TVAE.
3. The `filter.py` defines three anomaly detection methods: RANSAC, IF, and LOF.
4. The `model.py` defines the TabPFN framework
5. The `benchmark.py` defines eight benchmark ML models, which are used to compare with TabPFN
6. The `prediction.py` defines the whole experimental process.
7. All synthetic datasets can be downloaded [here](https://pan.quark.cn/s/efe0e27a961d). The password is `MT1G`.
